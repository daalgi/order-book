# Order Book
From [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-websockets-project-build-real-time-order-book-app/) and its [github repo](https://github.com/mihailgaberov/orderbook) and [live demo](https://orderbook-mihailgaberov.vercel.app/).

Technologies used:
- react with typescript
- `styled-components`
- redux
- react-websockets
- [`react-page-visibility`](https://github.com/pgilad/react-page-visibility) to kill the socket connection if the page is hidden, and save some resources.
